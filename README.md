GUI Application for the final project

The specifications for the project were to build a GUI application to manage the roster of a baseball team and a way to keep track of simple stats.
Tech requirements were to use a database to store the player data as well as construct classes to manage the players, roster and the interface.
Other than what the final look of the application, the rest of the programs structure was left for each student to design.
